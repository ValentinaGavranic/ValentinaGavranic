**Euro Score Buddy** is a real-time collaborative web app for scoring Eurovision performances with friends. Create a room, pick scoring categories (or add your own), and share the link. Each participant scores independently, and after the show, calculate your **EuroScore** to see who predicted the official results most accurately.
